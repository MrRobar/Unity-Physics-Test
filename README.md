A 2D scene with Box2d physics is given.
At different ends of the stage there are 2 cannons, which fire projectiles at the center at a slow speed.
There is a circular area in the center of the screen; all objects that fall into it are slowed down by 10 times.
You need to write code that implements this area taking into account the collision of projectiles and gravity.
